                        <p>How does the rental process work with the Enterprise Company?</p>
                        <input type="checkbox" name="faq">
                        <p class="respuesta">Once a prospective tenant identifies and has viewed a unit he/she is interested in renting, that person should submit a rental application.  Requirements for rental application consideration are listed below:<br><br>
                        $30 Application Fee for each adult 18 years old or older.<br><br>
Credit Report and Tenant Performance Report on each adult 18 years old or older through the National Tenant Network.  A negative report may cause rejection of the application.<br><br>
Valid Identification for each adult 18 years old or older must be produced.  The ID must include a photo and current address.   Acceptable IDs include a driver’s license, military ID, passport, etc.<br><br>
Written Income Verification. Monthly combined income of at least three (3) times the monthly rental rate of the applied for property. Each applicant must provide minimum of three (3) most recent pay stubs or formal written verification from the employing company of legal/reported income. Self-References. Current and/or previous landlords may be contacted.  A positive reference is required.<br><br>
Co-Signers. We only accept co-signers for full time students without derogatory credit.  Both the applicant and the co-signor must have positive credit histories and meet all other application requirements.  For students, proof of enrollment is required.<br><br>
RENTAL APPLICATION CHECKLIST – Please compile all these items for submission at the same time.<br><br>

□$30 application fee for each adult 18 years old or older.<br><br>

□Fully completed and signed Application to Rent for each adult 18 years old or older<br><br>

□Valid photo ID for each adult 18 years old or older.<br><br>

□Three (3) paycheck stubs or written verification of income as noted above for each adult applying.<br><br>

Once an application is complete and submitted the Enterprise Company will run the applicant’s credit and review the application.  Please note the approval process is not conducted by the listing agent.<br><br>
If approved, the Enterprise leasing department will contact the applicant to confirm if whether or not they would like to take the apartment.  If the applicant confirms the affirmative then a lease signing date is set and a minimal deposit will be required within two days of notice to hold the apartment.  Enterprise will not remove a unit from the market until funds are paid.<br><br>
Once the tenant has signed the lease and paid all necessary funds, a walk-through of the unit is conducted with the leasing agent.  Once complete, the keys will be handed over to the tenant and the move in process may begin.<br><br>
It is important to note the vast majority of questions tenants may have are answered by their lease, so it is a very important document to keep a hold of and read thoroughly.

                        <input type="checkbox" name="faq">
                        <p class="respuesta">Send Enterprise a letter signed by all current tenants requesting that we process an application for a new roommate and if approved add the roommate to the tenancy.  There is a $150.00 administration fee for this service in addition to the $30.00 application fee for the new tenants.  Then Enterprise will generate an addendum for all parties to sign to officially add the new roommate.  If you want to take off a roommate you must send Enterprise a letter as well stating the specific request with everyone on the tenancies signatures and the remaining tenants must still qualify with their income for the rent requirements.  AT NO TIME AS STATED IN YOUR LEASE IS SUBLETTING ALLOWED AND IT IS CONSIDERED A BREAECH OF YOUR LEASE.</p>

Items such as toys and paper towels (among many other things) will clog the pipes of toilets preventing proper function. Many buildings, especially in the Oakland area, are many decades old and may have more sensitive plumbing infrastructure. Please do not flush baby wipes and feminine sanitary products down the toilet.</p>

                        <input type="checkbox" name="faq">
                        <p class="respuesta">A few things to never put down your drain/garbage disposal:<br>
Any kind of stringy or tough-peeled vegetable such as asparagus, citrus peels, lettuce, celery, corn husks, artichokes, carrot and potato peels shouldn’t be put in the garbage disposal. Their string materials wrap themselves around the blades and prevent the motor from turning.<br>
Egg shells don’t belong in the garbage disposal. It has been rumored that egg shells help sharpen the blades, but this is a myth. The thin membrane layer attached to the shell can also wrap itself around the disposal’s shredder ring.<br>
Never put grease in a drain/garbage disposal, as it will eventually solidify and clog some or all of the drain.<br>
A disposal is not strong enough to break down animal bones, either. While the blades might break them down some, they will never be able to get them small enough to fit down the drain.<br>
Rice and pasta have the same problem—they can never be broken down small enough. And since they swell with water, smaller pieces will get bigger and gather in the trap until it is closed.<br>
Pits or seeds or thick skins from fruits and vegetables shouldn’t be put down the garbage disposal, as they can’t be broken down. They can damage or ruin your disposal and are better off being composted.<br>
Other items to trash instead of tossing down the disposal include twist ties, pull tabs, rubber bands, glass, screws and nails, utensils, cigarette butts, bottle caps, paper, plastic, fabric, string, rags, sponges, plants, flowers, children’s toys, or hair. None of these items will break down small enough to rinse easily down the drain. No matter how strong your garbage disposal is, it still has its limits.<br>
Please note that repairs to your disposal resulting from food scraps or items improperly placed in the disposal, or clogged drain lines could result in charges to your account.<br>
Please keep these tips in mind to avoid unnecessary costs, and to help ensure the proper function of your garbage disposal.</p>

                        <p class="respuesta">When you decide to move out and you have a date in mind, please contact the Enterprise Company, usually at least 30 days in advance.  Please follow the notice vacate instructions in your lease.  The most common circumstance is:<br><br>
                        Vacating after the term of your lease has turned month to month means you are required to submit a 30-day notice to vacate.  This notice informs the office you plan to move.  The tenant is responsible for rent through the end of the 30-day notice and until keys are turned in to the Resident Manager or Enterprise office.  </p>

                        <input type="checkbox" name="faq">
                        <p class="respuesta">Keys must be turned into the Enterprise Company for your tenancy to be officially terminated and to stop being charged for rent. Keys may be dropped off during Enterprise business hours or in the drop off box to the right of the front door.  Keys should be placed in a labeled envelope so that we know that we have received all keys and to whom they belong. Very important!  In the case where the tenant lives in a building with an on-site manager keys may be turned into the manager, again making sure they are properly labeled.  Keys should never be left in the unit to indicate you have moved out.  If you would like to confirm we have received your keys and you will no longer be charged for rent please give us a call. </p>
